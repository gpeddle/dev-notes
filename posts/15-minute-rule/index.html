<h1 class=title>The 15 Minute Rule</h1>
<div class=content>
<p><img src=/posts/15-minute-rule/neo-rubber-duck.jpg alt="No Rubber Ducks" title="No Rubber Ducks"></p>
<h2 id=rubber-ducks-considered-harmful>Rubber Ducks considered Harmful</h2>
<p>In recent years, &lsquo;Rubber Duck&rsquo; debugging has been popularized. It goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using rubber duck debugging, the developer is encouraged to talk about
their current technical problem with a toy rubber duck. Explaining the
problem to the duck will focus the developer&rsquo;s thoughts and help find a
solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This silliness might work, but it completely misses a much better method.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking to a duck, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. You need the <strong>15 Minute Rule</strong>, not a rubber duck.</p>
<h1 id=use-the-15-minute-rule-instead>Use the 15 Minute Rule Instead</h1>
<p>For many years, a rule for my development teams was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you run into a roadblock, something you can&rsquo;t figure out, you
have 15 minutes continue to beating your head against the wall.
Then, without ego, you need to go find someone &ndash; me, or another developer, and talk them through the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=heres-the-magic>Here&rsquo;s the Magic</h2>
<p>This simple rule has two magical properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Explaining a problem to someone often unlocks the detail you were missing. Your effort to organize the explanation has value. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who finds the solution as long as the path becomes clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeking help sooner rather than later prevents wasted hours on a problem that someone else knows how to solve.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The rubber duck method takes advantage of the first magical property (explanation), but it only involves one person&rsquo;s brain. And let&rsquo;s be honest - the duck isn&rsquo;t going to make fun of you, but he doesn&rsquo;t know the answer either.</p>
<h2 id=no-super-programmers>No Super-Programmers</h2>
<p>The worst failure of rubber duck debugging is that it reinforces the super-programmer myth. It encourages individuals to see themselves as &lsquo;winners&rsquo; who solve problems alone, rather than &lsquo;losers&rsquo; who need to get help. In reality, everyone needs help at some point, and pretending otherwise just wastes time.</p>
<p>The choice of 15 minute limit is completely arbitrary - in reality, my teammates often waited longer before taking to someone. I chose the 15 minute limit to make it completely OK to ask for help, immediately, without issue.</p>
<p>For the 15 Minute Rule to work, not only must developers be willing to seek a quick review here and there, their teammates must handle those requests gracefully, without ego. Celebrating this kind of assistance also a fantastic tool for team-building.</p>
<h2 id=summary>Summary</h2>
<p>Use the 15 Minute Rule to enhance communication and sharing among team members.</p>
