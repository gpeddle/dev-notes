It goes like this:
Using rubber duck debugging, the developer is encouraged to talk about their current technical problem with a toy rubber duck. Explaining the problem to the duck will focus the developer&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and help find a solution.

&amp;ldquo;This should be easy, right?”
If you are a creative-technical person, perhaps you just shivered in recognition. What is is about this phrase that makes us squirm?
