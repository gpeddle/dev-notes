## Rubber Ducks considered Harmful

In recent years, 'Rubber Duck' debugging has been popularized. It goes like this:

> Using rubber duck debugging, the developer is encouraged to talk about 
> their current technical problem with a toy rubber duck. Explaining the
> problem to the duck will focus the developer's thoughts and help find a
> solution. 

This silliness might work, but it completely misses a much better method. 

If you're talking to a duck, you're doing it wrong. You need the **15 Minute Rule**, not a rubber duck.


# Use the 15 Minute Rule Instead

For many years, a rule for my development teams was this: 

> If you run into a roadblock, something you can't figure out, you 
> have 15 minutes continue to beating your head against the wall. 
> Then, without ego, you need to go find someone -- me, or another developer, and talk them through the problem.

## Here's the Magic

This simple rule has two magical properties: 

1. Explaining a problem to someone often unlocks the detail you were missing. Your effort to organize the explanation has value. It doesn't matter who finds the solution as long as the path becomes clear.

2. Seeking help sooner rather than later prevents wasted hours on a problem that someone else knows how to solve.

The rubber duck method takes advantage of the first magical property (explanation), but it only involves one person's brain. And let's be honest - the duck isn't going to make fun of you, but he doesn't know the answer either.

## No Super-Programmers

The worst failure of rubber duck debugging is that it reinforces the super-programmer myth. It encourages individuals to see themselves as 'winners' who solve problems alone, rather than 'losers' who need to get help. In reality, everyone needs help at some point, and pretending otherwise just wastes time.

The choice of 15 minute limit is completely arbitrary - in reality, my teammates often waited longer before taking to someone. I chose the 15 minute limit to make it completely OK to ask for help, immediately, without issue.

For the 15 Minute Rule to work, not only must developers be willing to seek a quick review here and there, their teammates must handle those requests gracefully, without ego. Celebrating this kind of assistance also a fantastic tool for team-building. 

## Summary

Use the 15 Minute Rule to enhance communication and sharing among team members.
