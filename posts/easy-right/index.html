<h1 class=title>Easy, Right?</h1>
<div class=content>
<p><img src=easy-right.jpg alt="Easy button" title="Easy Button"></p>
<p>A few years ago, I encountered a customer who asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This should be easy, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are a creative-technical person, perhaps you just shivered in recognition. What is is about this phrase that makes us squirm?</p>
<p>When I first encountered the <strong>easy-right</strong> question, I immediately discounted it based on my assessment that the customer was saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I hope this will be easy, because otherwise it may be expensive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For technical people, this is a common experience. On the surface, the question seems innocent, but agreeing to the proposition puts you in a compromised position. In effect, you are saying that you are smart enough that nothing this simple could cause problems. Disagreeing says that maybe you are not up to the task. Explaining why this is hard makes everyone uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This is a major reason why technical people are often perceived as being gruff and protective. They face a never-ending stream of co-workers and customers that ask, <em>“Easy, right?”</em></p>
<h2 id=well-is-it>Well, is it?</h2>
<p>Answering ‘Yes’ to the easy-right question transfers the burden to the technical person, and answering ‘No’ leaves it on the customer. There is a huge incentive for the customer to transfer this burden: <em>“But, he said it would be easy!”</em> and there is little upside for the technical person to accept the unknown burden.</p>
<p>In effect, every conversation about easy-right can be seen as a different question :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m worried that this might be hard, are you smart enough to solve it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the technical person, this question can be impossible to gracefully answer, and this is the source of evasion and obfuscation. (C’mon, tech folks, it’s OK to admit —at some point you’ve spun a story to buy time in order to figure out whether the request is ‘easy’ or ‘hard’).</p>
<p>Over time, I’ve come to realize that the sales guy or customer asking the <strong>easy-right</strong> question is not trying to set a trap. He just doesn’t know the answer, regardless of what he is hoping for. This was not an obvious realization for me. What that person is actually asking for is <strong>agreement and reassurance</strong>, in same the way that all sales people are trained to search for consensus. The tech people, on the other hand want to work on <strong>well-defined problems</strong> that have <strong>reasonable deadlines</strong>.</p>
<p>Software people often complain that the sales people do not understand the challenges they face and that the sales force is clueless about how technology actually works. Sales people say the same thing, and think the software people lack social skills. When a typical interaction between these two types could be mostly jousting around the <em>easy-right</em> question, is there any wonder that the two sides do not understand and trust each other?</p>
<p>I’ve had some success with training friendly sales people on this topic, but even they resort to variations: <em>“Will this be difficult?”</em></p>
<h2 id=will-this-be-difficult>Will this be difficult?</h2>
<p>Ask a technical person this question and you’ll get a variety of answers. Posing the question this way lets the technical person off the hook: <em>“Are you smart enough&mldr;?”</em> and it also humbles the questioner — they are asking, because they just don’t know.</p>
<p>Tech people, take notice here: This relief is not what you want, even though it is much more comfortable. You really need that sales person to help the customer understand the technical challenges, so be nice, but make it as clear as possible.</p>
<p>What both sides actually need is a way to communicate about the relative difficulty and cost (in terms of both time, struggle and emotion) that a particular decision will entail.</p>
<p>Sales people, don’t just settle for deadlines and email, try to learn what the technical challenges entail and seek ways to reduce the impact of those challenges by working with (programming!?) the customer.</p>
<h2 id=check-your-assumptions>Check your assumptions</h2>
<p>To improve communication between Sales and Technical people, check for preconceived notions and clear up any basic problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the Sales people believe the Tech people understand the goals and are trying to help?</li>
<li>Do the Tech people believe the Sales people understand the solutions and will hold the line when customers ask for weird stuff?</li>
<li>For Customer goals, take the time to review deadlines and other Customer-facing issues so that Tech staff understand what the Sales staff are facing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=ask-different-questions>Ask different questions</h2>
<p>To get past this problem, consider changing the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How important it this to the paying customer?</li>
<li>Is the customer actually paying for this? (You’d be surprised how often the answer is ‘No’)</li>
<li>Can the same outcome be achieved more simply?</li>
<li>If this problem is caused by an external source, what can we tell the end-customer so that they will understand and manage the complexity on their side? (example: Bad input data from the customer)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=dont-be-afraid-to-say-its-hard>Don’t be afraid to say it’s hard</h2>
<p>When something is hard or has a serious impact to workload or schedule, everyone should be saying that it is hard, not just the technical staff.</p>
<p>In cases like this the Sales staff can really help by explaining the situation to the customer and ensuring all assumptions are reviewed and all alternatives are considered. Don’t be afraid to tell that customer your Tech staff is stretching — their problem is hard, after all.</p>
<p>If a request is hard, saying so enhances your credibility. Hoping or pretending otherwise hurts everyone.</p>
<h2 id=summary>Summary</h2>
<p>Remember, when you ask if something is <strong>easy-right</strong>, it’s a leading question.
Instead, try asking what the request means in terms of the workload or the impact on the project schedule and you’ll get far better answers.</p>
